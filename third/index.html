            Consider hiding the staus bar-and all other app
             UI-while people are actively viewing full-screen
              media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to 
              let people retrieve it(and the appropriate app 
              UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a 
              compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom 
              gesture to redisplay the status bar because users 
              are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to 
              remember it.
